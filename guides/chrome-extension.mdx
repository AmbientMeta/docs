description: Detect and strip PII directly in ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini

## Overview

**AmbientMeta Privacy Guard** is a Chrome extension that automatically detects PII as you type into LLM chat interfaces. It works on:

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)
- [Claude](https://claude.ai)
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)

The extension highlights detected entities inline and lets you sanitize text with one click before sending it to the LLM.

## How It Works

1. **Real-time scanning** — As you type in a chat input, the extension calls the AmbientMeta API to detect PII entities in your text.
2. **Inline highlighting** — Detected entities (names, emails, phone numbers, etc.) are highlighted directly in the input field.
3. **One-click sanitize** — Click the sanitize button to replace all detected PII with safe placeholders before sending your message.

All detection runs through the AmbientMeta backend API (`POST /v1/sanitize`), so detection quality is identical to the API and every scan feeds the learning flywheel.

## Authentication

The extension supports two modes:

### Signed Out (Free)

- Uses a shared extension key
- Limited to **50 sanitizations per day** (detection/highlighting is unlimited)
- No account required

### Signed In (Google)

- Sign in with Google via the extension popup
- The extension authenticates using `POST /v1/auth/google-extension`
- An API key is automatically provisioned for your account
- Unlimited sanitizations on paid plans

## Daily Limits

| Mode | Detection (highlighting) | Sanitization |
|------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Signed out | Unlimited | 50/day |
| Signed in (free plan) | Unlimited | 50/day (server-enforced) |
| Signed in (Pro) | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Signed in (Pro Plus) | Unlimited | Unlimited |

<Note>
Detection calls (for inline highlighting) do **not** count toward the daily limit. Only full sanitization requests are counted.
</Note>

## Configuration

The extension scans for these entity types by default:

- `EMAIL_ADDRESS` — Email addresses
- `PHONE_NUMBER` — Phone numbers
- `SSN` — Social Security Numbers
- `CREDIT_CARD` — Credit card numbers
- `LOCATION` — Places and cities
- `ADDRESS` — Physical addresses

## Technical Details

- **Manifest V3** Chrome extension
- Detection debounced at 1.5 seconds after typing stops
